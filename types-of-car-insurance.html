  <h1>Types of Car Insurance Coverage Explained</h1>
  <p>Choosing the right car insurance coverage can be confusing, especially with so many options available. This guide breaks down the main types of coverage so you can understand what each one does and decide what’s best for your needs.</p>

  <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>InsureWise Hub is a free resource that explains insurance topics in simple language. We focus on clarity, not complexity — helping people understand how insurance works, what coverage they need, and how to make smart decisions without pressure or confusion.</p>

  <h2>1. Liability Coverage</h2>
  <p><strong>Liability insurance</strong> is required in most places. It covers damage and injuries you cause to other people or their property. It does not cover your own car or injuries.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bodily Injury Liability:</strong> Covers medical expenses for others</li>
    <li><strong>Property Damage Liability:</strong> Covers repairs to others’ vehicles or property</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Collision Coverage</h2>
  <p><strong>Collision insurance</strong> pays for damage to your car if you hit another vehicle or object, regardless of who’s at fault. It’s especially useful for newer cars or if you drive in busy areas.</p>

  <h2>3. Comprehensive Coverage</h2>
  <p><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong> covers damage from non-collision events like theft, fire, vandalism, falling objects, or natural disasters. It’s ideal for protecting your car from unexpected risks.</p>

  <h2>4. Personal Injury Protection (PIP)</h2>
  <p><strong>PIP</strong> covers medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident, no matter who caused it. In some regions, it also covers lost wages and rehabilitation costs.</p>

  <h2>5. Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage</h2>
  <p>This coverage protects you if you’re hit by a driver who has no insurance or not enough insurance to cover the damage. It helps pay for medical bills and repairs when the other driver can’t.</p>

  <h2>6. Optional Add-Ons</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Roadside Assistance:</strong> Covers towing, battery jump, flat tire help</li>
    <li><strong>Rental Car Reimbursement:</strong> Pays for a rental while your car is being repaired</li>
    <li><strong>Gap Insurance:</strong> Covers the difference between your car’s value and what you owe on a loan</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Smart Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t overpay for coverage you don’t need</li>
    <li>Review your policy yearly</li>
    <li>Ask about discounts for safe driving or bundling</li>
    <li>Understand your deductible before choosing a plan</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>Understanding the types of car insurance coverage helps you make informed decisions. Don’t just pick the cheapest option — choose protection that fits your life.
